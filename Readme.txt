The program tries to help you analyse people and places in the Book of Mormon. 
It could be extended to the rest of the standard books.

The Books of Mormon text is included in a text file that is uploaded at first.

By navigating through the menuâ€™s options you will work with People, Places, Verses, Quote from verses, etc.

I have just completed the People Options.

The other ones will be for the future.

A class Menu together with a Menu.txt file has been use to simplify the code in the program class.

hen adding a person in Option 1, you may add his children name at the same time and 
they will be automatically create them as people and the relationship with their father.
